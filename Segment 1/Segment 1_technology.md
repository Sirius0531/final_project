# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will use Pandas to clean and filter the dataset.

## Database Storage
We will be using AWS and connecting to PostgreSQl to store our data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library. We are doing multiple Linear Regression Models utilizing different variables from our dataset. We are also testing adding the Random Forest Classifier to our model as well.  We will also use the Stats Model Library to evaluate the accuracy of our model.

## Dashboard
We will create an interactive dashboard where users can choose variable from a drop down and see visualizations created with plotly.  We will also use tableau to create visualizations for our presentation.
