Our project is to use the dataset to answer the question of How do different factors such as location, gender, education, and experience affect the anticipated salary for a Data scientist? That helps us has a better understanding of the factors that affect the salary level. By using different machine learning models we were able to get around 67% accuracy of the perditions. 

As a group, we have very smooth communication. We usually move on to the decision with full agreement among the whole group. Team members are usually self-led and know what to do next in the project.  We formed the initial data frame, choose the variables, found the correlations, and explored the machine learning models. Each week, every little progress motivates us a lot. 

Mackenzie is very detail-oriented and organized. She hosts all our meeting that outside of class time. During our meeting time, she leads us to walk through the rubric and make sure we are always on track for the projects.

Bowman is very knowledgeable and good at hunting down helpful information. He did much research and provide strong background when it came to the decision-making points. 

Radman helps clean the dataset and test on different models. He is very patient and willing to try any possibility, which is what we needed the most for machine learning. 

Stussy set up the database in AWS and linked it to local Postgres and organize the ERD. She always finishes her prat quick and comprehensive. 

My role is to support our team in all aspects. I helped whenever each team member needed it, from cleaning data, initiating the visualization, setting up the website dashboard, and making the final touch on Github since I own the main branch. Sometimes, I might have a vague idea, and my team was able to turn it into a solid action plan.  I had a great time working with this productive and fantastic group.
