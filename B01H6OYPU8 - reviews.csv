Not COCOA BUTTER,205 people found this helpful,Sherlock,-,1,2020-02-22T16:59:17,OK  it says in big letters on the label: COCOA BUTTER . Well its like the 17th ingredient and it has stuff in it like alcohol and the first ingredient is Mineral oil . Also I m a guy OK this stuff has a smell  well it s some ware between a baby and old lady. I know I know I should have checked the ingredients before buying it but it says in big letters right on the front COCOA Butter. Don t buy this if you want COCOA BUTTER! I opened it so I cant send it back. I m mad at my self for being so dumb and this company for false labeling .
Great for Minnesota winters!!,35 people found this helpful,Justmom,-,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,This is my new favorite body cream. For reference  I am 39 with combination skin as a whole; not so oily that I almost don t need moisturizer  not so dry that I m applying moisturizer all day long under normal circumstances. I bought this in abnormal circumstances because I needed something a little more high-octane to care for my skin (not face) through a particularly brutal Minnesota winter. This took good care of my arms  legs  torso and feet through bitter  dry cold without the need for reapplication throughout the day. With morning and night application  my feet remained quite soft and crack free  which is quite a feat for me! Obviously when regularly washing hands  reapplication is necessary there. Overarchingly this kept my skin comfortable in a very uncomfortable winter  though I m not sure it will be too heavy for gentler weather months  so I may consider using it year-round. The scent is gently cocoa butter that fades in a reasonable amount of time so I don t reek of cocoa butter all day long.
I Only Use this on My Face  Arms  and Shoulders,78 people found this helpful,Cape Cod Phil,-,4,2020-04-23T14:12:17,I was thinking the other day  man  how do those women in the Caribbean have such soft skin? So I did some research and it looks like Cocoa Butter is a staple. Polynesians and my brother slather themselves in Coconut Oil. And of course Africa gave us the much-touted Shea Butter. All three of these moisturizers are in Nivea Cocoa Butter Cream - but well after water and mineral oil  which are the top two ingredients.I decided to stick with Cocoa Butter  because the Caribbean is the region I ve traveled to the most. Been to Puerto Rico  the Dominican Republic (while the Presidential Palace of Haiti was burning down from a coup)  the Bahamas  and my favorite  Aruba.This big jar of Nivea Cocoa Butter is what I went with  partly because of a brand name  and partly because of price. It s a very nice product  white and creamy. It should be noted that it has perfume added so it does not smell like chocolate.I m getting old  so it s time to start paying attention to my skin. Hopefully it s not too late...p.s. Congrats to Nivea for having an excellent Men s line of products - body wash and shaving cream  in particular.
This is the very best widely available moisturizer I have ever used and I ...,40 people found this helpful,Mrs. Art Vandelay,-,5,2020-04-15T17:59:17,This is the very best widely available moisturizer I have ever used and I have tried everything. I have very dry  ahem  aging skin and this makes my skin look healthy and firm again. I love the cream texture rather than a lotion and I stay soft and supple all day long. I have given away all of my many bottles and jars of other creams and am only using this one.
Super moisture rich!,36 people found this helpful,Mile High Lover,-,5,2020-01-23T12:59:17,Love this! I was tired of the expense of The Body Shop s body butter creams and went with this and it is only fraction of the price. Also  you can just mix in some essential oils if you want something more fragrant than the light cocoa butter smell. I mixed in some lavender and I m going to try grapefruit next time.
LOVE this cream!,2 people found this helpful,Lucyfan,-,5,2020-02-10T17:59:17,I ordered this cream not knowing  what  to expect  but hoping that it was the type of cream that I wanted-- and to my delight  it IS!!! The texture and scent are perfect  and it works extremely well to keep my hands moisturized (without feeling greasy!)  especially during the harsh Midwest winter! The jar is an ample size  so the quantity of cream contained within should last for a while  making this an economical purchase  as well! So I highly recommend this cream  and will definitely plan to purchase it again in the future! :-)
A WINNER!!!,One person found this helpful,Penelope P.,-,5,2020-04-15T17:59:17,OMG!!! I have scary alligator skin accompanied by frightening knee wrinkles. Ugh. Everything I have ever tried (with the exception of JLO s favorite creme...but she s the only one that can AFFORD ($$$$) to slather not just her face but her whole body!) has left me dry again within HOURS. But not this!!! This creme is actually quite light for a creme (imo)  & KEEPS ME MOISTURIZED! I can use this after my morning shower  & later when going to bed am STILL MOISTURIZED! As for those creepy knee wrinkles? Adi√≥s! Bye-bye! Sure  I m 54  & they ll never be completely gone  but with this creme they re no longer staring at anyone across the room (& touching them feels so smooth!) :) :) :)
From Ashy To Classy,6 people found this helpful,Phill.The.Thrill,-,5,2020-06-27T11:59:17,After running out of my last lotion  I decided to go with this Nivea Cocoa Butter. I m a fan of Nivea products for men because they have items especially for us with sensitive skin so I knew they d take care of me on this lotion. The lotion goes a long way in that you don t need gobs in order to stay hydrated. I have noticed that my skin isn t as dry after a shower like it was when using my old lotion so I m pretty happy about that plus my wife loves the way it smells so that s a win.
Another great Nivea product!,One person found this helpful,InkedMama,-,5,2020-01-18T17:53:17,I love Nivea products. I picked up the 1$ tin of Nivea Creme at the store one day and have been in love since. Every product I ve tried has impressed me. I use the Nivea Creme (blue tub  german verison) when I m really dry. I also love the In Shower Body Lotion because I can slather it on in the morning and go! The creme is more of a night creme that is very thick but I wake up with the softest skin.Then I found this lotion! I hesitated because cocoa butter isn t my favorite scent. However this lotion sinks into your skin fast so its thinner than the creme in a good way. I also like the scent!I use the creme and lotion on my boys - 3 & 6. My little one begs to copy mommy & put lotion on  he loves it! Didnt even get into the blackberry tinted lip balm!
I love it,One person found this helpful,wild oak,-,5,2020-05-17T17:59:17,I ve been looking for a body cream that s nourishing enough for my dry skin during the long winter days. I try this  and love it. It s smooth  soothing and my skin feels so silky. I also love the fragrance which doesn t smell  cocoa  at all. (There s a lot of cocoa cream on the market that really smells like cocoa  but no  I don t want to smell like cocoa bean. It just smells fresh  with a hint of floral scene  and it doesn t smell much at all on the skin. Be mindful  this cream is rather  thick  and it s best for winter times  but I wouldn t use this during summer days.
Wow....just Wow!,One person found this helpful,Jasmine F. Edwards,-,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,Wow!....Just Wow! This stuff is amazing. It really does hydrate  smells fantastic  and is surprisingly the perfect constituency of thickness. I hate when body butters/cremes are water down and thin. I feel my skin really hydrating with this. I ve bought Jergens for years which I love but this even better. I m definitely switching! Highly recommend and for the price can t beat it!
Nivea never disappoints me!,-,Iberkis Faltas,-,5,2020-03-25T17:59:17,Love the fragrance because it smells fresh and clean  with a hit of cocoa butter. The scent is not overwhelming. Also  when I apply it  the lotion gets into the skin in no time and there is no stickiness or residues left behind. I love to soak myself in body lotion. The good thing about this one is that I don t have to walk around the room for the lotion to dry on my body because it drys almost instantly. Good work Nivea! You should try it.
BEST LOTION OUT THERE!,One person found this helpful,Steph01,-,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,MY FAVORITE LOTION EVER!!! I have always had a rough time finding a lotion that really moisturizes. I also have suffered with restless legs for a long time. This lotion is the best! Ever since I started using it my restless legs are gone and it keeps me moisturized all day. Great scent too! I always buy 3 when I purchase this. Great value too! Highly recommend I do not use any other lotion.
Buy at your own risk! They sent me a sketchy open package and won't return  replace or refund me.,20 people found this helpful,imanun2imanun2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MMu4RS-XL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ueX31S8EL._SY300.jpg,1,2020-07-16T12:59:17,I love this body cream. It works well  smells great and is high quality. It also has lasting effects. I use this almost exclusively during winter months. I d honestly recommend it to everyone.However...I do not love the fact that I was sent an unlidded  unsealed and open jar that was all over inside the box when I opened it. I went through the entire  packaging was good  item was damaged  procedure online  only to be told by Amazon this item isn t eligible at all. I find this to be unacceptable.There s no reason not to refund or replace this body cream. I shouldn t be stuck paying for an unusable damaged item. That s not what I bought and paid for.Please note: I have ordered this same product from Amazon at least 8 times previous. 7 of those 8 jars came in shrink wrap plastic. Which prevents these problems from occurring.This entire fiasco has been incredibly frustrating  and not really worth the time  stress  or money involved. Complete Amazon fail.Buyer beware! Do so at your own risk! If they send you an open package  you re stuck paying for it  regardless  just like me.
Love this,One person found this helpful,ESchulm,-,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,Nivea has been a staple even growing up  my grandma swore by it  she only used Nivea  she had great skin even when she got up into her 80s. It is really smooth and not too overpowering smelling. I highly recommend this cream.
Soft and silky skin,-,Bocce Girl,-,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,I use Nivea moisturizers daily  the Cocoa Butter Cream is the perfect body moisturizer. This cream absorbs into my skin immediately when I get out of the shower and does not leave my skin feeling oily. The Cocoa Butter has a slight tropical smell when you first apply it but it goes away quickly. I recommend trying this if you want soft  silky skin that looks as good as it feels.
Great product,-,Hauservi,-,5,2020-01-18T17:53:17,I have this on Subscribe and Save and LOVE everything about it. I live in a High Dessert community and in the Winter my skin gets so dry it hurts... This product is perfect to put next to your bed and moisturize your skin  after a bath  and before you go to sleep at night. I stay moisturized for 2-3 days.
Great for very dry skin,-,Raine,-,5,2020-04-17T17:59:17,I have a severe skin condition that gets irritated at almost everything I try and put on my skin. My skin gets very dry so I have to keep lotion  oil  or moisturizer on multiple times a day. This is some of the best body cream I ve found. It keeps my skin well hydrated  it doesn t break me out  and it has a decent smell to it. The fact that it is inexpensive too makes it wonderful. I usually have to spend TONS of money on skin care because of my skin condition. I just went thru my first jar and have ordered 2 more. I m so glad I found this product.
Perfect for Dry Climates,One person found this helpful,Jnghiem,-,5,2020-09-25T15:59:17,I spent the summer in El Paso and this saved my skin. Before  I would wake up at night scratching my legs bc of the climate despite moisturizing with a different lotion. Since using this lotion  not once have I woke up and scratched my self. The scent is a bit much but for all the moisturizing it does  I could care less. It is a bit thick of a texture but absorbs quite well. I will be using this in the winters as well. It is a very good value and I ve been using it nightly for two months and still have 75% of the product left.
O. M. Goodness!!,One person found this helpful,Jennifer DeBord,-,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,This stuff is the shtuff!! My skin hasn t been this smooth since my 20 s! I love  love  love this cream. A friend recently turned me on to this  I used hers  loved it and immediately bought two tubs. I use it every night  right after my shower. I typically forget to put lotion on but now I can t wait for my shower so I can put this on. If you re on the fence  not knowing if it s really all that good  it s like what $6.00? What are you really out? But trust me  it s SO worth it! I d still buy it if it were twice that.
