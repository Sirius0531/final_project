1,Jolene Byrne,Great to put in thank you bags,5,"  One of my jobs is being a personal shopper. I wanted to make up thank you bags, with a small treat, for my customers-they deserve appreciation too! These are PERFECT. Each bag has 3 mints in it and I put 2 in each thank you bag. Many ppl text and say how adorable they are.  And where did I get them!Most importantly is great attention I give each order, keeping my ratings high.  These little treats are just an extra way to remember me and to say thank you; without them, no job.Small investment can help influence tips, reviews, and preferred requests.Hereâ€™s a couple pics.  I purchase the cellophane bags in Amazon as well, they come with thank you stickers.  Then I buy rolls of plain brown stickers, also on Amazon, and include my first name (the roll had 500 stickers.  Economical!).Donâ€™t you like it when someone takes the time to give you a little treat ? We all like to be appreciated.

7,Karen,Little tic tac bags,5,"  These tic tac bags were adorable. I thought they would be a little bigger. Each bag had 4 tic tabs unit. I used them to put into the hotel bags for my daughters wedding. They were by far the smallest item added to the bags.ðŸ¤£

8,Molly,Super cute in their own little packs!!,5,"  Love these!  Who doesn't love TicTacs?  They're adorable in their own little packets of 4 tictacs. so cute each packet looks like a mini tictac box.I bought them to put out for my co-workers, they're fun and safe because they're individually wrapped.
