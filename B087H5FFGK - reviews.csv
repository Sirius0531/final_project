Best sunscreen,-,jessica chavez,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,Doesn t make me break out and protects all of my family members from being burned! Best sunscreen out there.
Love it,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-05-17T17:59:17,Easy to spread. Great texture.
Great protection year round from sun damage,-,2streetmom,-,5,2020-07-12T17:12:17,Great sun protection-recommended by the Dermatologist too
It clumps when you want to add second layer,One person found this helpful,Mah,-,3,2020-05-22T11:59:17,We used this product when we were out at the beach. So after an hour of swimming we thought we should add more to keep the protection high. We got clumps of cream on our skin immediately after adding the second layer. Not sure why and please give me answers if you think of something.I was not wearing any makeup  it was just the sunscreen.
Still smells like sunscreen,-,Shere R Johnson,-,3,2020-07-16T12:59:17,Good moisture.
Good for daily wear  not active wear.,-,D.C,-,2,2020-08-13T14:59:17,This sunscreen provides great protection but cannot be worn alone if you have normal to oily skin. Although it has no white cast  it leaves a very shiny finish that needs to be set with a powder. If that is not an issue  if you wear it on an active day where you ll be sweating or swimming  the sunscreen can get into your eyes and be very irritating. The scent of the sunscreen is also citrusy and quite strong. I personally don t mind fragrance  but in a product like sunscreen that requires being applied in a hefty amount and repeatedly  it gets to be too much. Overall I would not purchase it again for myself.
Awesome!,-,lindsey,-,5,2020-08-13T14:59:17,Love it! Use it every day as a moisturizer.
Do not use for sports!,One person found this helpful,Huckleberry,-,2,2020-05-15T12:59:17,Even though it says water and sweat proof  I got sunburnt even thought I applied it multiple times while outside. I like the lotion aspect of this product  but only for every days activities. For sports  I was really disappointed this this product.
Thick and sassy  and not in a good way,-,brownidegurl740,-,2,2020-01-11T11:59:17,This sunscreen is NOT cosmetically elegant or for  everyday.  It s like the gloppy  greasy  sticky coppertone you lather on your toddler except it s 5 times as expensive. 30 minutes after I applied a modest amount to my arms  it was still tacky. Doesn t live up to the hype.
Not for people with oily skin...,-,Jennifer Fix,-,3,2020-01-23T12:59:17,The product is not bad  but if you have oily skin this product is not for you. I am someone who has had oily skin my entire life and this sunscreen just made my skin look even oiler. I will say that it has great protection and a nice smell  but overall it was just too greasy for my already oily skin.
Great Product,-,cherry,-,5,2020-09-29T17:59:17,This is a good product. Will be buying more.
love this stuff,-,DMiller,-,5,2020-02-22T16:59:17,LOVE this sunscreen! It is lightweight  smells. nice and goes on smoothly with NO white residue.
lasts and smells good!,-,Alaa Alam,-,5,2020-09-29T17:59:17,My go-to sunscreen for all occasions. It doesn t leave white cast and you ll feel refreshed and protected.
Great!,-,Samantha,-,5,2020-07-12T13:59:17,The first sunscreen that does not break my skin out! It smells great and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and dewy. I will be repurchasing.
The best sunscreen available!,-,Norman A. Stahl,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,A real game changer! Easy on my sensitive skin  and protects for hours. Even on hot humid days! Love it!
Best sunscreen,18 people found this helpful,Mk,-,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,Just purchased this again when my son ended up sunburned with a sunscreen spray. We have been using supergoop sunscreen for thee years now- we have a pool so the kids needed it daily. My kids love it  super easy to put on. It doesn t leave white streaks. Has a pleasant smell. The kids have never complained about burning eyes. And as long as we used supergoop  they have never walked away burnt. Not sure if this new version “play” is any different but I hope not.
Great sunscreen,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,Love super goop! I have used this sunscreen for a few years. It s not greasy or smelly. Can wear it under clothes and not feel like have lotion on.
Great product!,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,This is the absolute best sunscreen! It protects my skin and it makes my skin feel so silky smooth. Will continue buying this product! Strongly recommended.
love it,-,lapatrada ruabruam,-,5,2020-07-02T17:54:17,easy to use and it s work
The founder made misleading claims about this product,10 people found this helpful,S. Hoen,-,1,2020-04-15T17:59:17,I bought this product based on the claims that the founder of the company made on the podcast  How I built this . She made several claims that seemed to set this apart from regular sunscreen on the podcast. She said that it was great for active people who play outdoor sports. She said that it didn t sting your eyes  smelled better than regular sunscreen  and that it felt better on your skin than regular sunscreen. Well  she was 0-3 for those claims. It stung my eyes WORSE than normal sunscreen  smells just like every other sunscreen and felt like any other sunscreen on my skin. Sure  it kept me from getting a sunburn but so does the cheap stuff.
Best one,-,Agnieszka,-,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,Best sunscreen ever!!!
My everyday sunscreen,15 people found this helpful,A. Hawley,-,5,2020-07-02T17:54:17,I bought this to test it out as a sunscreen for riding. I still haven t ridden with it on  but I ve used it everyday. One  it goes on super easy. I know when I ve finished an area. Next  it smells great. It smells like rosemary rather than sunscreen. Last  it layers well with my moisturizer. Although it does provide a fair amount of moisture on its own  I like to have a little additional moisturization.I had read good reviews about this product before  and now I believe them. I ll be buying this well into the future.
Very good product,-,Gigi tekle,-,5,2020-05-17T17:59:17,Love it
Great sunscreen,-,AmazonCustomer,-,5,2020-06-27T11:59:17,Lightweight sunscreen  great for your face
Summer Essential,8 people found this helpful,Chloe,-,5,2020-09-06T17:39:17,Easy to apply  no greasy and the pump is very convenient. My only minor complaint is that I haven t been able to secure the pump down so when I travel I wrap the sunscreen in plastic bags to prevent it from leaking. I burn very easily and this product has been a summer essential.
Good at it’s job as sunscreen  but feels like glue on your face.,-,L. Ward,-,3,2020-05-15T12:59:17,I love Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen  and thought this would be a less expensive option for all my grandchildren when they go to the beach. We don t mind this on our bodies  but hate the gluey feel on our faces. It s sticky for sure. It stays on pretty well in water  but again - yuk on our face.
Explodes when shipped,15 people found this helpful,caitlin,-,1,2020-09-29T17:59:17,I ordered this product twice from amazon and both time I ordered the bottle leaked 1/3 the contents out into the bubble wrap bag it was tape inside. Second attempt amazon was trying to correct the order  but it is a defect in Supergoops pump cap. They need to switch to a solid cap that you take off and add the pump after shipping. Other than that  this is my favorite sunscreen that I will purchase in store from now on.
Dermatologist recommended,2 people found this helpful,Robert Travis,-,5,2020-09-05T17:59:17,My dermatologist recommended this brand and size. It s not too greasy  it rubs in quickly and has a fresh scent  not too perfumey. I like the size  especially  I keep it on the bathroom counter and a partial pump is enough for my face  neck and arms  before I go to work.
Not for everyone. Some may have a bad reaction,7 people found this helpful,Alicia Khalil,-,1,2020-09-05T17:59:17,I bought this sunscreen because I heard good things about it. The first time I applied it wasn t such a great experience  I was out and it was a hot day. For some reason I felt my face was hot and looked at my mirror and noticed my face was red!! I gave it another try and it happened again but it took a day or so for the redness to disappear. It gave me a burning sensation and washed my face immediately after noticing my face was red as if I had a minor sunburn. That wasn t fun.
Great sunscreen,-,S. Ram,-,5,2020-09-05T17:59:17,I listened to the founder of the company on a podcast and was intrigued enough to buy her product. I love it! The lotion really softens my skin and I feel protected. It does still have a sunscreen smell  but it s much fainter that any other sunscreen I have ever used.
Love this,-,A. Rosser,-,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,Very moisturizing  no white residue  little to no fragrance! Finally a facial sunscreen that is perfect
Buy it!,-,Kham,-,5,2020-07-23T17:59:17,Finally!! A broad spectrum sunscreen that doesn t leave a white cast! It really is like a moisturizer. I recommend it over every thing else.
Love it.,-,Katherine,-,5,2020-01-23T12:59:17,I love this sunscreen. It s clear  works and smells really nice. Good on my son s sensitive skin.
Great sunscreen!!!,-,Karen,-,5,2020-02-22T16:59:17,Supergoop is a superior sunscreen!! It has a subtle fragrance & goes on nicely. Not sticky
No white cast!,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,I hate using sunscreen because of the white cast. So this is the first that doesn t leave a white cast. I like it so far but will see have to see how I do in the sun with it.
Perfect for my sensitive dry skin,-,Emilio G.,-,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,Favorite sunscreen- doesn t break me out and leaves me with a nice glow. I have very sensitive skin and this is the sunscreen for me.
Really works,-,Ms Toya07,-,5,2020-06-26T14:59:17,So far so good! I m an avid runner  Black female  and sweat. There was no white residue sitting on top of my skin as with other sunscreens. Perfect for me.
My face is saved!,-,Melanie,-,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,Good product - absorbs quickly and is not sticky or tacky. Smell is pleasant and not too strong. Follow the directions and reapply after a few hours for all day protection. Pleasantly pleased with the quality!
Best Sunscreen,6 people found this helpful,Jay,-,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,I hate applying sunscreen  but this stuff is the best I have ever used. I only use it on long bike rides (usually 50-100 miles). I apply it once and I believe I get solid protection. I know I should re-apply  but I m too sweaty during the ride and have no room to bring more with me. Regardless  it s a good product. A bit over-priced  maybe a lot over-priced. I would buy it as it goes on easily  doesn t have an overpowering scent and performs well when you sweat.
Nice and lightweight,-,Claire park,-,5,2020-07-12T13:59:17,The sunscreen is very lightweight like a lotion that I can wear before my makeup easily!
No White Cast,110 people found this helpful,Cmhoddy,-,5,2020-09-06T17:39:17,I love this product. I bought it for sun protection because I am using a product that has alpha hydroxy acid on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight yet it is very rich. It gives a beautiful sheen to the skin and without a white cast. I am a black women and that is one of the main problems with sunscreen for us. This brand knows how to do it. I have been using their Unseen face sunscreen for several months now and decided to see if they also had one for the body now that I am using the AHA. It was pricey   but you get so much and a little goes a long way. If you do a full pump be prepared to put it in several places before rubbing it in. A lot comes out with a full pump. I will never use anything else.
Don't recommend  would not buy again,88 people found this helpful,tomeryosipovichtomeryosipovich,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615JgvDgKCL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61z7ovhHjKL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JUNa-sVEL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aPlGOhZjL._SY300.jpg,2,2020-07-16T12:59:17,The media could not be loaded.  I have acne prone  oily combination and sensitive skin  and this was just awful for me.First of all there s this smell of sweet lemon juice which was for me terrible  and I see it contains some citrus ingredients and I don t understand why would you do that.Secondly  it s suuuuuper greasy!! It s so sticky and doesn t absorb AT ALL. I then started using it on my legs and arms to not waste it  but it was super sticky and icky on there too. It attracts so much dirt from the air and environment and it sticks to you and is just awful.About the protection and moisture  I have no idea.About breaking out from it- I don t know  I didn t use it long enough to check and notice it.I used it maybe 2 times since I received it and I hated it. Definitely will never buy again.The texture is light at first  but then when you spread it you can see it covers a lot and is actually really heavy.You can see (I hope) in the video I attached. Also you can see the shine and greasiness at the end and in my picture.On the face of course it is 5 times worse.What did work for me better: PURITO centella green 50 SPF  and La Roche Posay Anthelios 50+ SPF.
Great sunscreen that feels like regular lotion,28 people found this helpful,Heda,-,5,2020-04-17T17:59:17,We live in Florida and wear sunscreen every day - no matter what we are doing. This is by far the best sunscreen we have tried! Not greasy at all. I put this on in the morning and have it on all day; it just feels like a regular  nice lotion but with amazing sun protection. My husband and kids love it  too.
Reliable Everyday Sunscreen,36 people found this helpful,Customer,-,4,2020-04-23T14:12:17,I purchased this sunscreen a little over a week ago and have really enjoyed using it so far! I was initially torn between this product and the Unseen Sunscreen but decided to give this a try since it seemed more cost-effective (cheaper per ounce)  seemed it would function as a good substitute for a moisturizer  and the unseen sunscreen was not in stock at the time. Ultimately  I am very glad with my decision. When I first received my package (I ordered the larger size since the cost per ounce is cheaper than the smaller) I was a little bummed when the bag the sunscreen came in said it was supposed to be 7 ounces instead of 5. Also  when I put it on my face right away it felt kind of greasy  which is a common review it gets online. However  I since have been putting it on in the mornings after I wash my face and have not found it to be greasy at all. I have sensitive  oily acne-prone skin and was worried about how this product would feel/interact with my skin  but have overall been very impressed so far. It has a pleasant scent compared to most sunscreens  does not leave a white tint  and does a good job of moisturizing my oily skin. Would definitely recommend as a good option for a daily sunscreen!
Oh my....Yes!,2 people found this helpful,Miss W.,-,5,2020-09-29T17:59:17,I was really hesitant to pay 20+ dollars for sun protection  but I am not going to lie  this sun lotion is really good. I love that it s Black owned business is offered here on Amazon  more and more. Also  the scent is little to none (which I prefer)  it s very lightweight  gives me a dewy afterglow without white cast  and actually moisturizes my skin too-- and I have combination skin  so it works for the dry and oily zones of my face. I use it mostly for my face  neck  and hands. The dark spots from my recent breakouts have not gotten any darker  so it s actually really helping to lessen the affects of sun exposure and hyperpigmentation. Would definitely recommend. Worth the pay out.
NOT REEF SAFE !!!!,30 people found this helpful,shebeast,-,1,2020-05-17T17:59:17,Buyer beware! This sunscreen is not reef safe. Is contains Avobenzone  homosalate  octisalate and octocrylene which are all harmful to coral reefs. False advertising on web site and packaging. Not reef safe.
Best ever  you won't use another sunscreen ever.,One person found this helpful,Nia Mack,-,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,I ve bought this for my husband 2 years ago  and definitely recommend it. I use their whole line. Even with these crazy temperatures these last 2 years  he s never sunburned and his skin is beautiful. Does not burn the eyes or drip at all. I ve also used it on my grandkids. Worth every penny. If you care about your family s skin  I am telling you  you won t be disappointed! Any of Supergoop products! I use the whole line!
No white cast!,One person found this helpful,Cori,-,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,Excellent coverage - smooth and easy to apply. White cream that leaves a nice glow but doesn t leave a white cast. Obagi has a great product but pump package was frustrating because it delivers very little product at a time and is impossible to use all of the expensive product.Supergoop Play is the first sunscreen I don t mind using on my face.
Goop Play is exactly what I do!,One person found this helpful,dkmura,-,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,For an everyday sun screen you can t do much better than this stuff. I live in Colorado and the sun gets intense at high altitude. Goop Play is some of the best I ve used  with UVA/B protection and a nice scent to go along with it. I put it on after a shower in the morning and it penetrates and holds well all day long. Go with the pump bottle for a better value.
This is the best sunscreen I have ever had,One person found this helpful,Yellow Rose,-,5,2020-05-17T17:59:17,I have tried a variety of sunscreens but this is the best! I tried the small one to see what I thought and I really liked it. It s not sticky and it stays on while running which is what I needed it for so it holds up during a sweaty run and walk. I also needed full sun protection. After  using for two weeks  I decided to get the pump which is so much more convenient. It has a light scent. It didn t bother me.
Great on POC,One person found this helpful,Laurel Gardner,-,5,2020-07-16T12:59:17,Great protection. I have tried other brands that either left a white streak or caused irritation. After trying several sun screens this was the last
Does not run,One person found this helpful,Pamela Hernandez,-,5,2020-09-06T17:39:17,My son was getting continuously sunburned at football practice. All sunscreen products would run into his eyes so he refused to wear it. This is the first product that doesn t run into his eyes in 100 degree heat  practicing football.
Avoid! $22 for a long-lasting  painful allergic reaction,19 people found this helpful,Lizzy,-,1,2020-07-23T17:59:17,I wanted to love this product because I ve heard lots of good things about it  but alas! I made the mistake of not checking the ingredients list for chemicals that may react poorly with my skin—my own fault  for sure  as I took the “clean  natural ingredients” advertising as gospel. Don t make my mistake!This includes avobenzone as an active ingredient  which makes my skin feel like it s releasing actual hellfire in the form of a painful  burning  sticky rash of irritated skin and teensy-weensy blisters. I regrettably used the sunscreen on my cheeks and neck on a kayaking trip ten days ago—the rest of my body was covered by UPF clothing  thank my fairy godmother—and I m just today getting my normally smooth skin back  though I am still contending with peeling dryness where the rash was.If you didn t read this review in time and had a similar reaction  I m so sorry. Use minimal products on your skin while it heals; dampen the affected area  slather on petroleum jelly  and stay out of the sun as much as possible until it heals. Normal moisturizers and other sunscreens are not your friend yet.Whew. Okay  so  yeah—if you have sensitive skin or have had bad reactions to other sunscreens in the past  avoid this one and go for a zinc-based physical sunblock (like a certain Australian brand featuring a colorful amphibian) instead.
Even my ick phobic husband reaches for this stuff,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-06-26T14:59:17,I am Happy to be a dedicated fan ofPLAY!! And it s so gratifying to recommend it and have friends and family reply with enthusiasm for my efforts to share and enlighten. I m so happy to Play for keeps !
I keep trying others but keep coming back.,-,Matthew,-,5,2020-02-22T16:59:17,This is our favorite again and again. We ve tried MANY over the years and keep coming back to Supergoop! Play nee Everyday formula. It feels better on the face than most  face  sunscreens and lotions. It requires very little rub in and leaves no white.
This brand never disappoints!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,-,Sam,-,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,I love this formula! Love using on my kids and myself.The formula is very lightweight and easy to rub on skin. It doesn t leave a white layer that sunscreens typically do  and it doesn t make our eyes water👍🏻
Full coverage  but lightweight and sheer on darker skin tones.,-,mjndiaye,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,Absolutely love this sunscreen. It smells great  is super lightweight to put on  and is sheer. My little guys have dark skin and this lotion goes on smooth and sheer with excellent coverage. It is great for the whole family. This will definitely our go-to sunscreen until further notice.
A good product,One person found this helpful,Brooklyn Buckaroo,-,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,This goes on smoothly and blends right in. Not thick or  goopy . I ve been using Supergoop for years.
Work horse,-,k simmons,-,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,No smell  goes on & absorbs easily w/o a film & gives protection even through sweat - plus it s reef safe. Highly recommend.
Great sunscreen!,-,Missy Anderson,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,We live in the desert and need to put on sunscreen nearly every day. This is very light and has very little scent. I also like the the larger bottle with a pump!
Love this stuff,-,A. Moore,-,5,2020-07-12T13:59:17,So glad I found Supergoop Play! It smells wonderful  goes on quickly and doesn t leave any white residue. It is a little sticky  but find me a sunblock that isn t. It s expensive but I love the smell and level of protection so will probably be purchasing again - and I am the cheapest person I know.
AMAZING!,-,DAC,-,5,2020-07-12T17:12:17,AMAZING! No dry cast at all.
Excellent moisturizer,-,Rita,-,5,2020-09-05T17:59:17,Expensive But worth it.
Great Everyday Body Sunscreen,-,ncncnc001,-,5,2020-05-22T11:59:17,If you are looking for an everyday chemical sunscreen  this is your product! The product is not sticky or greasy and smells nice.

A must have!,-,Gabriela Vado,-,5,2020-05-22T11:59:17,This is a great non sticky  not greasy at all sunblock. I always make sure to have a tube of this at home.
The bomb.com,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-03-24T12:32:17,Love it..the best I ve had and will continue to use regularly
Still great just not the same,One person found this helpful,LL,-,4,2020-03-19T13:59:17,Product is almost the same as old formula. I prefer the old version  it was a little heavier in texture which was nice for dry skin. This one seems more liquid. Also I find the new formula to have a horrible taste if it gets near your lips after working out or beach. I know they revised ingredients to be coral safe but not sure if I will rebuy.
Good Product!,-,Anastazia Nichole,-,4,2020-07-12T17:12:17,It looks exactly like the photo and does what it should.I suggest shaking it before every use. The oil and moisturizer separate and you ll get just the oil if you don t mix it first. I have dry skin  so this is perfect for me because it has oil in it. It mostly dries but takes awhile  so I have to use a fan to help it. I m sensitive to fragrances and while this has a very subtle smell to it  it doesn t bother my sensitive nose or skin.
Best Sunscreen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,-,Bridget Kane-Berman,-,5,2020-03-24T12:32:17,Great smell  light weight  no burning/ suitable for my sensitive skin! Feels more like a nice non greasy lotion! Gives your skin a great glow! The only sunscreen I will use aside from Ulta MD which is also fab!
A dewy glow that is also protecting?!?,One person found this helpful,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-03-24T12:32:17,I love this stuff. It s lightweight  makes you glow  and doesn t smell like most sun protectant. What more could you need? Highly highly recommend for people with normal to dry skin.
Great safe alternative to mineral sunscreen for kids,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,Perfect  safe sunscreen for my kids that is easy to put on and does a great job! We usually prefer a reef safe mineral sunscreen because it s free of bad chemicals for kids and fish  but it takes so long to rub in and isnt a quick process. This Play sunscreen from Supergoop is the perfect alternative with still great ingredients.
great sunscreen,-,Chong,-,5,2020-07-12T17:12:17,It held up really great  I sweat a lot and the sunscreen didn t wipe off easily. It felt really light on my skin too! the smell was like any other sunscreen but it wasn t as strong so i didn t mind.
Great product & arrived early,-,Maisy Daisy,-,5,2020-04-15T17:59:17,Supergoop sun protection arrived early! Great product and the only sun screen that I use. Especially good in strong sun. No weird scent or smell.

No white film!,4 people found this helpful,Sandra,-,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,I m big on sunscreen because I want to prevent skin cancer and early aging. That being said  I generally loathe putting it on because most sunscreens leave a white film  and they leave your skin feeling sticky and gross. Supergoop Play feels almost like regular lotion. It s just a little stickier than regular lotion upon application  but it s not bad at all compared to most sunscreens. There s also no white film left behind so I m not left looking like a ghost. And it s effective. I used this on a hiking trip in Utah where there was no shade and every day there was full sun  and it kept me protected.
Great product!,-,Gorky Alexandrovich,-,5,2020-08-13T14:59:17,Leaves a slight shininess to my skin  but not greasy. Lightweight and does not smell terrible. I m extremely content with this sunscreen. I ll definitely buy it again.
Love it!!,-,Gabriel Ojeda,-,5,2020-07-12T17:12:17,This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever used. There is absolutely no white cast  and it serves as a great moisturizer. Many other sunscreen brands tend to irritate my skin  so I was pleased when it didn t. The sunscreen is not thick  but rather runny. Overall  I would definitely recommend this sunscreen to my friends.
Best Sunscreen I Ever Used,-,D. Deeb,-,5,2020-02-22T16:59:17,I ve tried so many sunscreens in the past. They were either too greasy or made me break out  but Supergoop is perfect for my skin type. It goes on light and feels great.
Great product  horrible shipping,One person found this helpful,therealswimshady,-,2,2020-07-16T12:59:17,The product itself is great and we will continue to buy it  but not from Amazon. We had two packages in a row where they shipped the large pump container in an envelope  and by the time it arrived to us it had broke open and spilled everywhere.

Good product,-,Norman,-,5,2020-02-10T17:59:17,Good protection without the white residue normal sunscreens leave behind. Have to apply more often since it doesn t last long in the water.
Does not disappoint!,One person found this helpful,HOLLY SALK,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,I m a swimmer and stay in water for an hour at a time. Protects great and would highly recommend for non-physical sun screen.
Not invisible,-,Andra,-,2,2020-02-10T17:59:17,I was looking for a large quantity invisible Supergoop sunscreen  this wasn t it. It is too thick.

No White Cast,110 people found this helpful,Cmhoddy,-,5,2020-02-10T17:59:17,I love this product. I bought it for sun protection because I am using a product that has alpha hydroxy acid on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight yet it is very rich. It gives a beautiful sheen to the skin and without a white cast. I am a black women and that is one of the main problems with sunscreen for us. This brand knows how to do it. I have been using their Unseen face sunscreen for several months now and decided to see if they also had one for the body now that I am using the AHA. It was pricey   but you get so much and a little goes a long way. If you do a full pump be prepared to put it in several places before rubbing it in. A lot comes out with a full pump. I will never use anything else.
Don't recommend  would not buy again,88 people found this helpful,tomeryosipovichtomeryosipovich,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615JgvDgKCL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61z7ovhHjKL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JUNa-sVEL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aPlGOhZjL._SY300.jpg,2,2020-05-17T17:59:17,The media could not be loaded.  I have acne prone  oily combination and sensitive skin  and this was just awful for me.First of all there s this smell of sweet lemon juice which was for me terrible  and I see it contains some citrus ingredients and I don t understand why would you do that.Secondly  it s suuuuuper greasy!! It s so sticky and doesn t absorb AT ALL. I then started using it on my legs and arms to not waste it  but it was super sticky and icky on there too. It attracts so much dirt from the air and environment and it sticks to you and is just awful.About the protection and moisture  I have no idea.About breaking out from it- I don t know  I didn t use it long enough to check and notice it.I used it maybe 2 times since I received it and I hated it. Definitely will never buy again.The texture is light at first  but then when you spread it you can see it covers a lot and is actually really heavy.You can see (I hope) in the video I attached. Also you can see the shine and greasiness at the end and in my picture.On the face of course it is 5 times worse.What did work for me better: PURITO centella green 50 SPF  and La Roche Posay Anthelios 50+ SPF.
Great sunscreen that feels like regular lotion,28 people found this helpful,Heda,-,5,2020-08-13T14:59:17,We live in Florida and wear sunscreen every day - no matter what we are doing. This is by far the best sunscreen we have tried! Not greasy at all. I put this on in the morning and have it on all day; it just feels like a regular  nice lotion but with amazing sun protection. My husband and kids love it  too.
Reliable Everyday Sunscreen,36 people found this helpful,Customer,-,4,2020-02-18T17:23:17,I purchased this sunscreen a little over a week ago and have really enjoyed using it so far! I was initially torn between this product and the Unseen Sunscreen but decided to give this a try since it seemed more cost-effective (cheaper per ounce)  seemed it would function as a good substitute for a moisturizer  and the unseen sunscreen was not in stock at the time. Ultimately  I am very glad with my decision. When I first received my package (I ordered the larger size since the cost per ounce is cheaper than the smaller) I was a little bummed when the bag the sunscreen came in said it was supposed to be 7 ounces instead of 5. Also  when I put it on my face right away it felt kind of greasy  which is a common review it gets online. However  I since have been putting it on in the mornings after I wash my face and have not found it to be greasy at all. I have sensitive  oily acne-prone skin and was worried about how this product would feel/interact with my skin  but have overall been very impressed so far. It has a pleasant scent compared to most sunscreens  does not leave a white tint  and does a good job of moisturizing my oily skin. Would definitely recommend as a good option for a daily sunscreen!
Oh my....Yes!,2 people found this helpful,Miss W.,-,5,2020-08-13T14:59:17,I was really hesitant to pay 20+ dollars for sun protection  but I am not going to lie  this sun lotion is really good. I love that it s Black owned business is offered here on Amazon  more and more. Also  the scent is little to none (which I prefer)  it s very lightweight  gives me a dewy afterglow without white cast  and actually moisturizes my skin too-- and I have combination skin  so it works for the dry and oily zones of my face. I use it mostly for my face  neck  and hands. The dark spots from my recent breakouts have not gotten any darker  so it s actually really helping to lessen the affects of sun exposure and hyperpigmentation. Would definitely recommend. Worth the pay out.
NOT REEF SAFE !!!!,30 people found this helpful,shebeast,-,1,2020-07-16T12:59:17,Buyer beware! This sunscreen is not reef safe. Is contains Avobenzone  homosalate  octisalate and octocrylene which are all harmful to coral reefs. False advertising on web site and packaging. Not reef safe.
Best ever  you won't use another sunscreen ever.,One person found this helpful,Nia Mack,-,5,2020-07-12T17:12:17,I ve bought this for my husband 2 years ago  and definitely recommend it. I use their whole line. Even with these crazy temperatures these last 2 years  he s never sunburned and his skin is beautiful. Does not burn the eyes or drip at all. I ve also used it on my grandkids. Worth every penny. If you care about your family s skin  I am telling you  you won t be disappointed! Any of Supergoop products! I use the whole line!
No white cast!,One person found this helpful,Cori,-,5,2020-03-24T12:32:17,Excellent coverage - smooth and easy to apply. White cream that leaves a nice glow but doesn t leave a white cast. Obagi has a great product but pump package was frustrating because it delivers very little product at a time and is impossible to use all of the expensive product.Supergoop Play is the first sunscreen I don t mind using on my face.
Goop Play is exactly what I do!,One person found this helpful,dkmura,-,5,2020-01-23T12:59:17,For an everyday sun screen you can t do much better than this stuff. I live in Colorado and the sun gets intense at high altitude. Goop Play is some of the best I ve used  with UVA/B protection and a nice scent to go along with it. I put it on after a shower in the morning and it penetrates and holds well all day long. Go with the pump bottle for a better value.
This is the best sunscreen I have ever had,One person found this helpful,Yellow Rose,-,5,2020-01-11T11:59:17,I have tried a variety of sunscreens but this is the best! I tried the small one to see what I thought and I really liked it. It s not sticky and it stays on while running which is what I needed it for so it holds up during a sweaty run and walk. I also needed full sun protection. After  using for two weeks  I decided to get the pump which is so much more convenient. It has a light scent. It didn t bother me.
