## Database Storage
We will be using AWS and connecting to PostgreSQl to store our data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library. We are doing multiple Linear Regression Models utilizing different variables from our dataset.

## Dashboard
We will use tableau to create an interactive dashboard with visuals of our findings and the ability for the user to filter on different variables.
